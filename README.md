# PLFinalProject
The powerpoint will highlight the requirements of this project, and will guide how we tackled the requirements.  While this was an academic
project.  I felt that I had a drive to find answers to the problems that I was presented throughout the timeline of this project.  It was
also nice to have a project that highlights many of the things I have learned in school.

Highlighted Files to Look at: 
In the Final_Project_lisp folder, there are two main files that interact with the PLY interface we created in minilisp.py: Stream.java 
and TabClass.py.  If you are not familiar with PLY, http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ is very helpful.  In Final_Project_swift folder, the files
to look at are Swift.py, lex.py, lis.py, and yacc.py.  Again, this is all working with the PLY package to create a subset of swift.  Use
the presentation to see I/O examples and guidance!

List of things I learned: 
1. Closures
2. List comprehension
3. PLY
4. Creating a subset of a language (even if I didn't do it the "right way")
5. Stream operations
6. More Java, Swift, Lisp, and Python
7. How to work with IntelliJ

Thanks!
